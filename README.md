This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving undefined behavior due to modifying a vector through a raw pointer after potential reallocation. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to modify a vector's element via a raw pointer without considering that the vector's internal data might have been moved during reallocation. This could result in memory corruption. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version of the code that avoids unsafe operations and potential undefined behavior.  Using safe Rust methods ensures that vector modifications are handled correctly and avoids memory corruption issues.
